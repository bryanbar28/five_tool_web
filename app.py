    _The Deep-Research 5-Tool Employee Framework_
    A behavioral operating system for high-performance environments. Designed to evaluate not just output, but behavior under pressure, natural tendencies, and the psychodynamic tensions that determine real-world effectiveness.
    Each tool includes:
    - Natural Gift: Innate tendencies that fuel the behavior
    - High-Functioning Expression: What excellence looks like
    - Dysfunction Signals: How strengths derail under pressure
    - Behavioral Insights: How to calibrate for sustained impact
    - Where It Shows Up: Cross-industry applications and archetypes
    #### Speed - Cognitive & Behavioral Agility
    Natural Gift: Pattern recognition, emotional agility, perceptual timing
    High-Functioning Expression:
    - Adjusts mid-motion with grace and clarity
    - Communicates with precise cadence-knowing when to pause, pivot, or push
    - Integrates feedback without spiraling or flinching
    - Creates momentum without overcomplication
    Dysfunction Signals:
    - Reacts impulsively to maintain control or optics
    - Mistakes urgency for depth
    - Avoids structure, defaults to charisma
    - Performs rather than processes under pressure
    Behavioral Insight: Psychological agility is the governor here-not raw reaction speed. Sustainable performance depends on metabolizing tension, not just masking it.
    Where It Shows Up:
    - Change management
    - Customer-facing adaptation
    - Executive communication in volatile contexts
    #### Power - Ownership, Initiative & Decisiveness
    Natural Gift: Inner drive, conviction, will to close
    High-Functioning Expression:
    - Owns the mission from start to finish-no deflection
    - Pushes progress without waiting for consensus
    - Makes high-impact decisions that others align behind
    - Brings heat without burning bridges
    Dysfunction Signals:
    - Bulldozes collaboration for speed
    - Hides behind motion to deflect reflection
    - Overuses authority or energy to silence dissent
    - Equates charisma with clarity
    Behavioral Insight: Unchecked Power erodes trust. Under stress, ego and volume increase-but clarity and alignment disappear. Humility is the ultimate limiter.
    Where It Shows Up:
    - Founders and team leads
    - Accountable closers and operators
    - High-pressure roles with final-call authority
    #### Fielding - Strategic Foresight & System Protection
    Natural Gift: Systems awareness, anticipatory thinking, stability
    High-Functioning Expression:
    - Spots second- and third-order consequences early
    - Operates upstream of risk, not downstream of damage
    - Stays composed when uncertainty spikes
    Dysfunction Signals:
    - Becomes overly risk-averse or defensive
    - Resists new data or shifts in environment
    - Defaults to rigid safeguards that halt innovation
    - Blames others when overwhelmed
    Behavioral Insight: Fielding reveals emotional maturity through discipline-not reaction. Pressure doesn't break systems. People do, when foresight is missing.
    Where It Shows Up:
    - Compliance, audit, legal, ops
    - Strategic planning, QA, IT architecture
    - Team stabilizers and culture protectors
    #### Hitting for Average - Reliability, Rhythm & Repeatability
    Natural Gift: Execution discipline, operational precision, resilience
    High-Functioning Expression:
    - Anchors workflows and norms others depend on
    - Focuses on base hits, not glory swings
    Dysfunction Signals:
    - Resents lack of recognition in flashy cultures
    - Over-indexes on habit and under-indexes on strategy
    - Performs tasks mechanically, loses intent
    Where It Shows Up:
    - Ops, customer success, fulfillment
    - Risk-sensitive execution roles
    - Individual Contributors who prevent chaos and catch the slack
    #### Arm Strength - Communication Reach & Influence
    Natural Gift: Expressive clarity, emotional connection, presence
    High-Functioning Expression:
    - Pitch it
    - Distills vision into language that moves people
    - Connects across functions and hierarchies effortlessly
    - Communicates emotionally and intellectually
    Dysfunction Signals:
    - Charms without delivering substance
    - Dominates conversations, silences opposition
    - Uses messaging to mask misalignment
    - Prioritizes performance over truth
    Behavioral Insight: Influence that isn't anchored in clarity becomes theater. Real communication reaches not just ears-but identity and belonging.
    Where It Shows Up:
    - Sales, enablement, leadership
    - Cross-functional translators
    - Cultural brokers and stakeholder wranglers
